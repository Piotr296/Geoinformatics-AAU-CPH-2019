Exercise 2
The IT department at Aalborg University (AAU) intends to automatically generate email addresses for its students and staff.
Write a code for them in Python to do this job faster. To do so, write a python script to ask for inputting first name, 
family name and your birth year of each person and to return an ID code
including the first character of your first name + a dot + the first 5
characters of your family name + the last two digits of your birth year
and generates an email address from AAU domain (aau.dk).
Populate your list with the name of at least 5 persons. Do not forget to
include comments in your script as well as an introduction about your
code in the beginning (e.g., author, date, code functionality, etc.).

Exercise 3
Write a script, which adds all odd numbers between 1 and 100 (both inclusive) and finally writes the result to
the screen. Run the script and check the result. Write a Python script that computes and prints all prime
numbers that are less than 100. Run the script and check the result.

Exercise 4
Write a code to receive guesses for a number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. Use module random.

Exercise 5
Outlier detection in a point cloud dataset
Write a script which reads an input ASCII file with X Y Z laser points (blank separated: data.txt) 
and checks the points for outliers. Outlier points are points with high or low zcoordinate values z>80.0 or z<75.0.
The script will
-Read the input file name data.txt:
-Write detected outliers to a file called as the input file + suffix "outlier_": outlier_data.txt
-Write all other points into a file called as the input file + suffix "pts_": pts_data.txt
-The user should be informed about each step (e.g. number of outliers, number of
points).
